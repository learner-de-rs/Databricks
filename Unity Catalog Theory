Centralized governance solutions across all your workspace in one repository

Based on SQL

Three level hierarchy: usually in sql it will be database.schema.table_name but you can use catalog.schema.table_name

Provide two types of layers: Storage Credential(apply to entire storage container)
                              External Location(storage directories within a cloud storage container)

Identity Federation : once access is given to an identity no need for separate access for difference users with same catalog

Delta Sharing : Share and receipt

Privileges : create,select,modify,execute,usage,read files,write files 

You can use GRANT statement for unity catalog to give permissions : GRANT {PRIVILEGE} ON {OBJECT} TO {PRINCIPLE)

Principle can be user,service principle,group
